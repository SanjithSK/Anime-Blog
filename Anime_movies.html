          The word "anime" is very often associated with "anime series," which
          are undoubtedly well-loved and attract more and more fans every day.
          However, diving into an anime series can prove itself to be quite the
          commitment as some of the most popular ones count 100+ episodes.
          Although some shorter, yet no less amazing series can be found if one
          takes the time to do a bit of digging around, one needs to be prepared
          to invest a lot of time into this world.

          itself a place among the best rated and most well-loved anime movies
          of all time. Despite its bright and colorful design, A Silent Voice
          tells a deep, emotional, and powerful story that takes the viewer
          through a rollercoaster of emotions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The movie explores incredibly deep and hard subjects such as suicide
          and bullying. A Silent Voice follows two children through middle
          school and high school as they struggle to find their place in the
          world and learn that each of their actions has deeper and darker
          consequences than they would have thought.

          In his quest to find a cure for his curse, Prince Ashitaka finds
          himself caught up in a war between the god of the forest and humans.
          Along his travels, he meets a young woman named San who was raised by
          wolves and seems to be more of a wild animal than a human being.
        </p>
        <p>
          Together, they will fight to protect the God of the forest from the
          corruption brought by man and their hunger for power. While Princess
          Mononoke is pretty graphic and targets a more mature audience, it is
          definitely a must-see.
